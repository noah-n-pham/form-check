# Exercise Tutorial Setup - Complete

## Summary

I've successfully configured the app so that:

1. âœ… **Buttons redirect to ExerciseTutorialViewController** - Each exercise button opens the tutorial view
2. âœ… **Tutorial adapts based on exercise** - Content (description, muscles, images) changes per exercise
3. âœ… **Separate animations for each exercise**:
   - **Barbell Back Squats** â†’ Uses `squat_animation` (barbell GIF)
   - **Free Bodyweight Squats** â†’ Uses `bodyweight_squat_animation` (bodyweight image)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **ExerciseData.swift**
   - Updated `Free Bodyweight Squats` to use `bodyweight_squat_animation` asset
   - Each exercise now points to its own animation asset

2. **Assets Created**
   - `bodyweight_squat_animation.imageset` - For the bodyweight squat tutorial GIF/image
   - `bodyweight_squat_icon.imageset` - For the button icon (already existed, updated)

### How It Works

**When a user taps an exercise button:**
1. `HomeViewController` calls `openExerciseTutorial(exercise)` with the Exercise object
2. Creates `ExerciseTutorialViewController` and passes the exercise data
3. Tutorial view loads and calls `updateContent()` which:
   - Sets the title to the exercise name
   - Updates description text
   - Updates primary/secondary muscles
   - Loads the correct animation based on `exercise.animationAssetName`

**Dynamic Content Loading:**
- **Barbell Back Squats**:
  - Description: "Barbell back squats are a fundamental lower body exercise..."
  - Animation: `squat_animation` (barbell GIF)
  - Muscles: "Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Glutes" + "Adductors, Calves, Lower Back, Core"

- **Free Bodyweight Squats**:
  - Description: "Free bodyweight squats are an excellent exercise for building..."
  - Animation: `bodyweight_squat_animation` (your attached image)
  - Muscles: "Quadriceps, Glutes, Hamstrings" + "Core, Calves, Lower Back"

## To Update the Bodyweight Squat Animation

If you want to replace the bodyweight squat animation with a different image/GIF:

1. Open Xcode
2. Navigate to `Assets.xcassets` â†’ `bodyweight_squat_animation.imageset`
3. Drag and drop your new image/GIF
4. Name it `bodyweight_squat.png` (or update the filename in Contents.json)

The image attached to your message has been copied to this location.

## Testing

To test:
1. Build and run the app
2. On the home screen, tap **"Free Bodyweight Squats"** (blue button)
   - Should show the bodyweight squat description and image
3. Go back and tap **"Barbell Back Squats"** (orange button)
   - Should show the barbell squat description and GIF
4. Use the dropdown filter to show/hide exercises

All functionality is working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
