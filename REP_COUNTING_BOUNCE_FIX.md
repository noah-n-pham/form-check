# Rep Counting Bounce Fix - Critical State Machine Issue

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FOUND & FIXED!

Your reps weren't counting because the state was **bouncing** instead of returning to standing!

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **From Your Console:**

**First Rep:**
```
standing → descending → inSquat → ascending
Then: ascending → descending ❌ (BOUNCED! Should be standing!)
```

**Second Rep:**
```
descending → inSquat → ascending
⏹️ Analysis stopped (never returned to standing)
```

**Result:** **ZERO reps counted** because `ascending → standing` never happened!

---

## 🔴 The Bounce Problem

### **What Was Happening:**

```
User rises from squat:
  Hip-to-Ankle: 165px → 190px → 215px → 220px

State machine sees:
  Hip-to-Ankle: 220px (below 270px threshold)
  Hip movement: +5px (slightly down)
  Conclusion: "Must be descending again!"
  
  State: ascending → descending ❌
```

**Why this is wrong:**
- User is STANDING (just with minor sway)
- Hip-to-Ankle 220px is close to standing (~300px)
- ±5px movement is just natural body sway
- Should recognize this as STANDING, not new descent!

---

## ✅ The Fix - Lenient Ascending → Standing

### **Three Improvements:**

**1. Special Case for Ascending State:**
```swift
if currentState == .ascending && hipToAnkle > 200.0 && abs(hipMovement) < 15.0 {
    // Close to standing with minimal movement
    desiredState = .standing  // Assume standing!
}
```

**2. Higher Movement Threshold:**
```swift
// OLD: if hipMovement > 1.0 → descending
// NEW: if hipMovement > 3.0 → descending

// Ignores ±2px natural sway
```

**3. Default Ascending to Standing:**
```swift
if currentState == .ascending && abs(hipMovement) < 3.0 {
    desiredState = .standing  // Finish the rep!
}
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior Now

### **Complete Rep Cycle:**

```
Standing:
  Hip-to-Ankle: 300px ✅

Descending:
  Hip-to-Ankle: 250px → 200px → 150px

InSquat:
  Hip-to-Ankle: 140px ✅
  Form analysis runs

Ascending:
  Hip-to-Ankle: 150px → 200px → 220px

Near Standing (NEW LOGIC):
  Hip-to-Ankle: 220px (> 200px threshold)
  Hip movement: ±2px (< 15px)
  Current state: ascending
  
  Conclusion: "User is standing!" ✅
  Desired State: standing
  
  ✨ STATE CONFIRMED: ascending → standing ✨
  ❌ REP COUNTED: #1 - BAD FORM
```

---

## 🎯 Thresholds Adjusted

### **Movement Detection:**

**Before:**
```swift
if hipMovement > 1.0 → descending
// Too sensitive! ±2px sway triggered descent
```

**After:**
```swift
if hipMovement > 3.0 → descending
// Ignores natural sway, only real movements
```

### **Standing Detection (Ascending State):**

**Before:**
```swift
if isInStandingPosition → standing
// Required hip-to-ankle > 270px
// Your values: 220-230px → never triggered!
```

**After:**
```swift
if ascending && hipToAnkle > 200.0 && |movement| < 15.0 → standing
// More lenient! Recognizes near-standing position
// Your values: 220px → triggers! ✅
```

## 🧪 Test Now - Should Count Reps!

**Do ONE complete squat:**

**Expected console:**
```
🔄 Starting new squat attempt

State: Descending
🔒 Side LOCKED

State: InSquat (hip-to-ankle: 140px)
Form analysis: BAD (2 issues)

State: Ascending (hip-to-ankle: increasing)

Near Standing (hip-to-ankle: 220px, movement: ±2px)
🧍 Near standing position with minimal movement
✨ STATE CONFIRMED: ascending → standing ✨
🔓 Side UNLOCKED

❌ FULL REP COUNTED: #1 - BAD FORM
📊 Total Attempts: 1 | Full: 1 (✅0 good, ❌1 bad)

Reps: Total: 1 ✅ (Not 0 anymore!)
```

---

## 📊 Your Specific Values

**From console:**
- Hip-to-Ankle when ascending: 215-230px
- Standing threshold: 270px (too high for you!)
- Hip movement: ±2-5px (natural sway)

**The new logic:**
```
if ascending && hipToAnkle > 200.0 && |movement| < 15.0:
    220px > 200 ✅
    2px < 15 ✅
    → Standing! ✅
```

**Should work for your setup!**

---

## ✅ What Changed

### **State Machine Logic:**

**Before (Too Strict):**
```
ascending state:
  if hipToAnkle > 270px → standing
  else if moving down (>1px) → descending
  
Your values: 220px, movement ±2px
Result: ascending → descending (bounce!)
```

**After (Lenient):**
```
ascending state:
  if hipToAnkle > 270px → standing
  OR if hipToAnkle > 200px AND movement < 15px → standing
  OR if movement < 3px → standing (default for ascending)
  
Your values: 220px, movement ±2px
Result: ascending → standing ✅ (rep counts!)
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

**Do 2 complete squats:**

```
Rep 1:
  States: standing → descending → inSquat → ascending → standing ✅
  ❌ FULL REP COUNTED: #1
  Total: 1

Rep 2:
  States: standing → descending → inSquat → ascending → standing ✅
  ❌ FULL REP COUNTED: #2
  Total: 2

Final: Total Attempts: 2 | Full: 2 (✅0 good, ❌2 bad)
```

---

## 🚀 Test It Now!

**Build and run, do ONE rep, watch for:**

```
✨✨✨ STATE CONFIRMED & CHANGED: ascending → standing ✨✨✨
❌ FULL REP COUNTED: #1 - BAD FORM
📊 Total Attempts: 1 | Full: 1
```

**If you see this, the fix works!** The bouncing issue is resolved and reps will count! 🎯
