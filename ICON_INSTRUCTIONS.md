# Custom Icon Instructions

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented the following features:

### 1. **Dropdown Filter**
- Added three filter options: "All exercises", "With equipment", "No equipment"
- Filtering works correctly:
  - "All exercises" shows both Barbell and Bodyweight squats
  - "With equipment" shows only Barbell Back Squats
  - "No equipment" shows only Free Bodyweight Squats

### 2. **Button Styling**
- Removed the circular background from the Free Bodyweight Squats button
- Changed the button color to a more blue color (less purple):
  - RGB: (0.20, 0.40, 0.80) - A true blue color

### 3. **Custom Icon Support**
- Added support for custom icons in the button view
- Created the asset directory: `bodyweight_squat_icon.imageset`
- The system will now look for a custom icon image and use it if available

## Adding Your Custom Icon

To add the custom squat icon you provided:

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **Navigate to**: `FormCheck/Assets.xcassets/bodyweight_squat_icon.imageset/`
3. **Add your icon image**:
   - Drag and drop your icon image into the imageset folder
   - Or use the "+" button in Xcode to add the image
4. **Name the file**: Use the exact same image file from your image description (the pixelated squat icon)
5. **Update Contents.json** if needed (Xcode usually does this automatically)

The image should be:
- **Asset name**: "bodyweight_squat_icon"
- **Recommended size**: 32x32 to 64x64 pixels
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or any format supported by iOS
- **Background**: Should work with your purple background image, or use a transparent background

## How the Filter Works

When you select a filter from the dropdown:
- The UIAlertController shows all three options
- Selecting an option updates the title and filters the visible exercises
- Exercise buttons are dynamically created/removed based on the filter
- The heart button and action handlers work correctly for all exercises

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **ExerciseData.swift**: Added `requiresEquipment` and `customButtonIconName` properties
2. **HomeViewController.swift**: Complete rewrite with:
   - Filter functionality
   - Dynamic button creation
   - Custom icon support
   - Removed circular background container

### Files Created:
1. **bodyweight_squat_icon.imageset/Contents.json**: Asset configuration

## Current Button Colors

- **Barbell Back Squats**: Orange (systemOrange)
- **Free Bodyweight Squats**: Blue (RGB: 0.20, 0.40, 0.80)

The Free Bodyweight Squats button now has a true blue color instead of the previous purple-blue mix.
