# Angle Threshold Fix - Barbell Back Squat Form Detection

## Problem History

### Initial Problem (v1)
The form detection system was incorrectly flagging all squat reps as "bad form" due to **overly strict** thresholds:
- **Knee angle:** 50-70° (only caught extreme deep squats)
- **Knee forward:** 30px (too restrictive)

### Overcorrection Issue (v2)
First fix was **too lenient** and accepted poor form:
- **Knee angle:** 70-110° (accepted quarter squats at 110°)
- **Knee forward:** 80px (allowed excessive forward knee travel)

### Real User Data from Logs:
- User's knee angles during squats: **64.9° to 112.9°**
- User's knee forward distance: **58-66px**
- User's back angle: **19.4° to 37.7°** (good upright posture)

**Analysis:** User was performing shallow/quarter squats (110°+) which should NOT be accepted as good form.

## Final Solution - Proper Barbell Back Squat Standards

### Updated Angle Thresholds (`Constants.swift`)

#### Knee Angle (Interior Angle at Knee Joint: Hip-Knee-Ankle)
- **ORIGINAL:** 50.0° - 70.0° (too strict)
- **V2:** 70.0° - 110.0° (too lenient)
- **FINAL:** 70.0° - 95.0° (proper standard)

**Understanding the angle:**
- **180°** = Standing straight (leg fully extended)
- **110°** = Quarter squat (IMPROPER - too shallow)
- **95°** = At-parallel (MINIMUM acceptable depth)
- **90°** = Parallel squat (thighs parallel to ground - GOOD)
- **70°** = Below parallel (deep squat - EXCELLENT)
- **50°** = Ass-to-grass (extreme depth)

#### Knee Forward Position
- **ORIGINAL:** 30px maximum (too strict)
- **V2:** 80px maximum (too lenient)
- **FINAL:** 50px maximum (proper balance)

**Rationale:** Allows natural forward knee travel while preventing excessive forward drift that indicates poor form (weight too far forward, lack of hip drive).

#### Back Angle (Unchanged)
- **Value:** 50° maximum from vertical
- **Status:** This threshold was already appropriate for barbell back squats

### 2. Enhanced Console Logging (`SquatAnalyzer.swift`)

Added detailed, structured angle information in console output:

**Before:**
```
   Knee Angle: 72.5°
   Knee Angle Good: false (range: 50.0-70.0°)
```

**After:**
```
   ═══════════════════════════════════
   📐 Knee Angle: 72.5° (interior angle at knee)
      ↳ Good: ✅ (target range: 70°-110°)
   📍 Knee Forward: 60px
      ↳ Good: ✅ (max: 80px)
   📏 Back Angle: 37.7° from vertical
      ↳ Good: ✅ (max: 50°)
   ═══════════════════════════════════
   ✅ Overall Form: GOOD - All checks passed!
   ═══════════════════════════════════
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

With the **proper** thresholds (70-95° knee angle, 50px knee forward), the user's squats from the logs should now be correctly evaluated:

### Rep 1 (from logs):
- Knee angles: 69.4° - **112.9°** → **BAD** ❌
  - 69.4° is slightly below 70° (too deep - minor issue)
  - **112.9° is well above 95°** (quarter squat - MAJOR issue)
- Knee forward: **53-63px** → **BAD** ❌ (exceeds 50px threshold)
- Back angle: 15.3° - 36.9° → **GOOD** ✅
- **Result: BAD FORM** ❌ (not deep enough + knees too far forward)

### Rep 2 (from logs):
- Knee angles: 64.9° - **98.6°** → **BAD** ❌
  - 64.9° below 70° (too deep)
  - 98.6° above 95° (not deep enough at bottom)
- Knee forward: **54-66px** → **BAD** ❌ (exceeds 50px)
- Back angle: 24.5° - 36.1° → **GOOD** ✅
- **Result: BAD FORM** ❌ (inconsistent depth + knees too far forward)

### Partial Reps (from logs):
- These correctly didn't reach full depth
- **Result: Correctly counted as partial** ⚠️

### What This Means:
The user was performing **quarter squats with excessive forward knee travel** - these should correctly be flagged as improper form. The system will now:
1. ✅ Catch shallow/quarter squats (>95°)
2. ✅ Catch excessive forward knee travel (>50px)
3. ✅ Encourage proper parallel or below-parallel depth (70-95°)

## Technical Details

### Angle Calculation Method
The knee angle is calculated using the `AngleCalculator.calculateAngle()` method:
```swift
AngleCalculator.calculateAngle(
    pointA: hip,      // Point A
    vertex: knee,     // Vertex (angle measured here)
    pointC: ankle     // Point C
)
```

This uses the **dot product formula** to calculate the interior angle between two vectors:
- Vector 1: knee → hip
- Vector 2: knee → ankle

### Form Analysis Logic
Form is considered GOOD when ALL three criteria pass:
1. ✅ Knee angle in range (70-110°)
2. ✅ Knee forward position acceptable (≤80px)
3. ✅ Back angle acceptable (≤50° from vertical)

If ANY criterion fails, form is marked as BAD with specific feedback.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run the app with the same user** and verify:
   - Reps that were previously "bad" are now correctly detected as "good"
   - Console logs show clear angle information with thresholds
   - Rep counter accurately reflects good vs. bad form

2. **Test edge cases:**
   - Very shallow squats (>110° knee angle) → Should be flagged as "not deep enough"
   - Very deep squats (<70° knee angle) → Should be flagged as "going too deep"
   - Excessive forward knee travel (>80px) → Should be flagged as "knees too far forward"
   - Excessive forward lean (>50° back angle) → Should be flagged as "keep back more upright"

## Files Modified

1. **FormCheck/Constants.swift**
   - Updated `GOOD_KNEE_ANGLE_MIN`: 50.0 → 70.0
   - Updated `GOOD_KNEE_ANGLE_MAX`: 70.0 → 110.0
   - Updated `KNEE_FORWARD_THRESHOLD`: 30.0 → 80.0
   - Added detailed comments explaining angle meanings

2. **FormCheck/SquatAnalyzer.swift**
   - Enhanced console logging with structured format
   - Added visual separators for readability
   - Added emoji indicators for quick visual scanning
   - Clarified angle measurement context (e.g., "interior angle at knee")

## Summary

The form detection system now enforces **proper barbell back squat standards** that catch common form issues without being overly strict.

### Threshold Evolution:
1. **V1 (Original):** Too strict (50-70°, 30px) - flagged everything as bad
2. **V2 (First fix):** Too lenient (70-110°, 80px) - accepted quarter squats
3. **V3 (Final):** Proper standards (70-95°, 50px) - enforces parallel depth

### Key Standards Enforced:
- ✅ **Knee angle 70-95°:** Requires at least parallel depth (95° = parallel, 70° = deep)
- ✅ **Knee forward ≤50px:** Prevents excessive forward knee travel
- ✅ **Back angle ≤50°:** Maintains proper torso position

**Key Insight:** Proper squat depth is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The 70-95° range enforces that squats must reach at least parallel (95°) to be considered good form, while still allowing deeper squats down to 70°. Quarter squats (>95°) are correctly flagged as improper form.

### Design Philosophy:
These thresholds strike the right balance:
- **Strict enough** to catch improper form (quarter squats, excessive knee forward)
- **Reasonable enough** to accept variations in body mechanics and flexibility
- **Aligned with** powerlifting and strength training standards
