# Body Detection & Positioning Guide System

## ✅ Complete Implementation

The body detection tracking and positioning guide system is now fully integrated!

---

## 📦 New Components

### 1. **BodyDetectionManager.swift**

Tracks body detection state with intelligent logic:

#### **Features:**
- ✅ Validates all 8 required joints are detected
- ✅ Checks confidence threshold (≥ 0.5) for each joint
- ✅ Tracks timestamp of last valid detection
- ✅ Allows 2-second grace period for temporary occlusion
- ✅ Counts consecutive frames without full body detection
- ✅ Triggers guide if > 30 frames without body

#### **Key Methods:**

```swift
// Update detection state with current pose data
func updateDetectionState(poseData: PoseData) -> Bool
// Returns: true if all 8 joints detected with good confidence

// Check if positioning guide should be shown
func shouldShowPositioningGuide() -> Bool
// Returns: true if guide should be displayed

// Reset state (call when view appears)
func reset()
```

#### **Detection Logic:**

**Full Body Detected When:**
- All 8 joints present: shoulders, hips, knees, ankles (left & right)
- Each joint has confidence ≥ 0.5
- OR had valid detection within last 2 seconds (grace period)

**Guide Shows When:**
- No valid detection in last 2 seconds
- OR 30+ consecutive frames without full body
- OR never had a valid detection since start

### 2. **PositioningGuideView.swift**

Semi-transparent overlay with positioning instructions:

#### **Visual Elements:**
- 📱 **Black overlay** (60% opacity) covering full screen
- 📝 **White text**: "Position yourself 6 feet away, side view"
- 🚶 **Stick figure illustration** drawn with UIBezierPath
  - Head (circle)
  - Body (vertical line)
  - Arms (angled lines)
  - Legs (bent at knees)

#### **Methods:**

```swift
// Show guide with fade-in animation
func show(animated: Bool = true)

// Hide guide with fade-out animation
func hide(animated: Bool = true)
```

#### **Layout:**
- Fullscreen overlay (covers entire view)
- Text at top (100pt from safe area)
- Stick figure centered on screen
- Automatic fade animations (0.3s duration)

### 3. **Integration in CameraTestViewController**

Automatically manages guide visibility:

#### **Setup:**
- ✅ `BodyDetectionManager` instance created
- ✅ `PositioningGuideView` added as fullscreen overlay
- ✅ Guide shown initially when view appears
- ✅ Detection state reset on each appearance

#### **Real-time Updates:**
In `didUpdatePoseData`:
1. Updates body detection state
2. Checks if guide should be shown
3. Animates guide in/out based on detection
4. Logs detection status to console

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow:

```
1. User opens test view
   → Guide shows: "Position yourself 6 feet away, side view"
   
2. User positions themselves
   → Camera detects body
   
3. All 8 joints detected with confidence ≥ 0.5
   → Guide fades out (0.3s animation)
   → Colored dots visible on joints
   
4. User moves temporarily out of frame
   → 2-second grace period (guide stays hidden)
   
5. After 2 seconds OR 30 frames without body
   → Guide fades back in
   
6. User repositions
   → Body detected again
   → Guide fades out
```

### Detection States:

#### **✅ Body Detected (Guide Hidden)**
- All 8 joints visible
- Each joint confidence ≥ 0.5
- Guide smoothly fades out
- Dots tracking normally

#### **⚠️ Temporary Loss (Grace Period)**
- Some joints missing
- But had valid detection < 2 seconds ago
- Guide stays hidden (user just moving)
- Allows natural movement without annoying guide

#### **❌ Body Not Detected (Guide Shown)**
- Missing joints for > 2 seconds
- OR 30+ consecutive frames without full body
- OR never detected since start
- Guide fades in with instructions

## 📊 Smart Detection Features

### 1. **Grace Period (2 seconds)**
Prevents guide from flickering during:
- Quick movements
- Temporary occlusion (arm blocking hip)
- Brief turns or adjustments
- Natural squat motion

### 2. **Frame Counter (30 frames)**
Shows guide if persistent issues:
- User too far/close
- Wrong angle
- Poor lighting
- Partial body in frame

### 3. **Confidence Threshold**
Only counts joints with confidence ≥ 0.5:
- Ignores low-quality detections
- Ensures reliable tracking
- Prevents false positives

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test 1: Initial Guide Display
1. Launch app and navigate to test view
2. **Expected**: Guide shows immediately
3. **Expected**: See stick figure and instructions

### Test 2: Body Detection
1. Position yourself 6 feet away, side view
2. Stand still until all 8 dots appear
3. **Expected**: Guide fades out smoothly
4. **Expected**: Console shows "✅ Body: true"

### Test 3: Temporary Occlusion
1. While detected, quickly raise arm in front of body
2. Lower arm within 2 seconds
3. **Expected**: Guide stays hidden (grace period)
4. **Expected**: Dots reappear when arm lowered

### Test 4: Persistent Loss
1. Walk completely out of frame
2. Stay out for 3+ seconds
3. **Expected**: Guide fades back in
4. **Expected**: Console shows "❌ Body: false"

### Test 5: 30 Frame Threshold
1. Stand at awkward angle (only 6 joints visible)
2. Stay in this position
3. **Expected**: After ~2 seconds (30 frames), guide appears
4. **Expected**: Prompts you to reposition

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Positioning Guide Appearance:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Position yourself 6 feet       │  ← White text
│  away, side view                │    Top of screen
│                                 │
│                                 │
│            🚶                   │  ← White stick figure
│           /|\                   │    Centered
│           / \                   │
│                                 │
│                                 │
│       [Semi-transparent         │
│        black background         │
│        60% opacity]             │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Stick Figure Details:
- **Head**: 15pt radius circle
- **Body**: 3pt white stroke
- **Arms**: Angled outward slightly
- **Legs**: Bent at knees (squat-ready pose)
- **Style**: Simple, clear, universally understood

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Tunable Parameters (in BodyDetectionManager):

```swift
// Maximum time since last detection before showing guide
private let maxTimeSinceDetection: TimeInterval = 2.0

// Maximum consecutive frames without body
private let maxConsecutiveFramesWithoutBody: Int = 30

// All 8 joints required
private let requiredJoints: Set<VNHumanBodyPoseObservation.JointName>
```

### Adjust These If:

**Guide appears too quickly:**
- Increase `maxTimeSinceDetection` to 3.0-4.0
- Increase `maxConsecutiveFramesWithoutBody` to 45-60

**Guide doesn't appear when needed:**
- Decrease `maxTimeSinceDetection` to 1.0-1.5
- Decrease `maxConsecutiveFramesWithoutBody` to 15-20

**Too strict joint requirements:**
- Reduce to 6 required joints (remove ankles)
- Lower confidence threshold to 0.4

## 📝 Console Output

### Detection Status Logging:

```
🦴 Test Mode: ✅ Body: true | Joints: 8 | FPS: 15.2
🦴 Test Mode: ✅ Body: true | Joints: 8 | FPS: 14.8
🦴 Test Mode: ❌ Body: false | Joints: 6 | FPS: 15.1
🦴 Test Mode: ❌ Body: false | Joints: 4 | FPS: 15.0
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ = Full body detected, guide hidden
- ❌ = Body not detected, guide may show
- Joints count shows how many joints detected
- FPS indicates performance (target: 13-16)

## 🎯 Integration for Production

This system is ready to integrate into `CameraViewController`:

```swift
// In CameraViewController.swift

private let bodyDetectionManager = BodyDetectionManager()
private let positioningGuideView = PositioningGuideView()

// In viewDidLoad:
setupPositioningGuide()

// In didUpdatePoseData:
let bodyDetected = bodyDetectionManager.updateDetectionState(poseData: data)
let shouldShowGuide = bodyDetectionManager.shouldShowPositioningGuide()

if shouldShowGuide {
    positioningGuideView.show(animated: true)
} else {
    positioningGuideView.hide(animated: true)
}
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Before moving to production, verify:

- [ ] Guide shows on initial launch
- [ ] Guide hides when body detected (all 8 joints)
- [ ] Grace period works (2 seconds of temporary loss)
- [ ] Guide reappears after persistent loss
- [ ] Animations are smooth (no lag or jitter)
- [ ] Text is readable on all devices
- [ ] Stick figure is clear and centered
- [ ] No performance impact (FPS stays 12+)

## 🚀 Status: Complete & Ready for Testing

The body detection and positioning guide system is fully implemented and integrated into the test view. Test it now to verify smooth operation before integrating into production!

**Next Steps:**
1. Test on device with real body detection
2. Verify guide shows/hides appropriately
3. Tune thresholds if needed
4. Integrate into `CameraViewController` for production
