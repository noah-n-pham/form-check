## 🔬 Scientific Principles of Proper Squat Form

### **1. Knee Angle (80-100° at bottom)**

**Why this matters:**
- Too small (< 80°): Excessive stress on knee joint, potential injury
- Too large (> 100°): Not reaching proper depth, incomplete squat
- Sweet spot (80-100°): Optimal muscle engagement, safe joint angles

**How to measure:**
- Angle formed by: **Hip → Knee → Ankle**
- Measured at the **bottom position** of squat (deepest point)
- Use vector math: `atan2` or dot product approach

**When to evaluate:**
- ✅ Only when in `.inSquat` state (bottom of squat)
- ❌ NOT during descent or ascent (changing angles)

---

### **2. Knee Position Relative to Toes (< 30px forward)**

**Why this matters:**
- Knees past toes = excessive forward knee travel
- Increases shear force on knee joint
- Can indicate quad dominance over glutes

**How to measure:**
- Compare knee X-position to ankle X-position
- In side view: `kneeX - ankleX` should be small
- Threshold: < 30 pixels on screen

**When to evaluate:**
- ✅ Only when in `.inSquat` state
- ❌ Knees can go forward during descent (normal)

---

### **3. Back Angle from Vertical (< 60°)**

**Why this matters:**
- Too much forward lean = stress on lower back
- Indicates weak core or poor hip mobility
- Can lead to "good morning" squat pattern

**How to measure:**
- Angle of shoulder-hip line from vertical
- Use `atan2(deltaX, -deltaY)` to get angle from vertical
- Threshold: < 60° lean forward

**When to evaluate:**
- ✅ Only when in `.inSquat` state
- ❌ Some forward lean during descent is normal

---

### **4. Hip Depth (Hip Y > Knee Y + threshold)**

**Why this matters:**
- Proper depth = full range of motion
- Hips below knees = "breaking parallel"
- Essential for muscle activation

**How to measure:**
- In screen coordinates: Y increases downward
- Hip below knee = `hipY > kneeY`
- Threshold: Hip must be 50+ pixels below knee

**When to evaluate:**
- ✅ Continuously (determines squat state)
- This triggers the `.inSquat` state

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: Always Showing "Good Form"**

**Root Cause:**
- Form analysis only happened in `.inSquat` state
- State was never transitioning to `.inSquat`
- Threshold was too small (20px → 50px)

**Fix:**
```swift
// OLD: Too small for side view at 5-7 feet
private let squatDepthThreshold: CGFloat = 20.0

// NEW: Realistic for actual squat depth
private let squatDepthThreshold: CGFloat = 50.0
```

---

### **Issue 2: Knee Angle Always "N/A"**

**Root Cause:**
- Knee angle only calculated in `.inSquat` state
- Since state never reached `.inSquat`, angle was never calculated

**Fix:**
- Increased depth threshold to 50px
- Added comprehensive debugging logs
- Improved state detection logic

---

### **Issue 3: Side View Compatibility**

**Root Cause:**
- Original code required ALL 8 joints (left AND right)
- In side view, only one side is clearly visible
- Code would fail if any joint missing

**Fix:**
```swift
// NEW: Works with either left OR right side
// Try left side first
if leftShoulder && leftHip && leftKnee && leftAnkle available {
    use left side
} else if rightShoulder && rightHip && rightKnee && rightAnkle available {
    use right side
} else {
    cannot analyze
}
```

## 📊 Real-Time Detection & Analysis Process

### **Frame-by-Frame Pipeline (15 FPS):**

```
EVERY FRAME:
│
├─ 1. POSE DETECTION (CameraPoseManager)
│   └─ Detect 15 joints with Vision
│   └─ Convert to screen coordinates
│   └─ Send PoseData to delegate
│
├─ 2. STATE DETECTION (SquatAnalyzer.determineState)
│   ├─ Get hip and knee Y positions
│   ├─ Calculate: hipY - kneeY
│   ├─ If > 50px → isInSquat = true
│   ├─ Track movement direction (up/down)
│   └─ Determine state:
│       ├─ Standing: Hip ~same height as knee
│       ├─ Descending: Hip moving down
│       ├─ InSquat: Hip 50+ px below knee ← TRIGGERS FORM ANALYSIS
│       └─ Ascending: Hip moving up from squat
│
└─ 3. FORM ANALYSIS (Only when state == .inSquat)
    ├─ Select visible side (left OR right)
    ├─ CALCULATE KNEE ANGLE:
    │   └─ angle(hip, knee, ankle)
    │   └─ Check: 80° ≤ angle ≤ 100°
    │
    ├─ CHECK KNEE POSITION:
    │   └─ kneeForward = |kneeX - ankleX|
    │   └─ Check: kneeForward ≤ 30px
    │
    ├─ CALCULATE BACK ANGLE:
    │   └─ angleFromVertical(shoulder, hip)
    │   └─ Check: angle ≤ 60°
    │
    └─ DETERMINE RESULT:
        ├─ All checks pass → isGoodForm = true
        └─ Any check fails → isGoodForm = false, identify primary issue
```

## 🎯 When to Evaluate What

### **Continuously (Every Frame):**
- Hip/knee position for state detection
- Movement direction tracking
- Body detection status

### **Only When in `.inSquat` State:**
- ✅ Knee angle calculation
- ✅ Knee forward position check
- ✅ Back angle calculation
- ✅ Form quality assessment

**Why?** Angles are meaningless during transitions. Only the bottom position matters for form.

## 📐 Scientifically Correct Squat Form

### **Biomechanics of a Good Squat:**

```
SIDE VIEW (What Camera Sees):

Standing Position:
    Head
     |
  Shoulder ──────┐
     |           │ Upright torso
    Hip ─────────┘  (< 60° from vertical)
     |
   Knee ────┐
            │ Extended leg
   Ankle ───┘

Bottom Position (Good Form):
    Head
     ╲
   Shoulder ──────┐
      ╲           │ Slight forward lean
      Hip ────────┘  (< 60° from vertical)
      │╲
      │ ╲
     Knee ────┐     Knee angle: 80-100°
      │      │
      │      │
    Ankle ───┘
    
    Knee aligned with or slightly behind ankle
    Hip BELOW knee level (proper depth)
```

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis Criteria

### **1. Knee Angle Detection**

**Calculation:**
```swift
kneeAngle = calculateAngle(
    pointA: hip,        // Top of knee
    vertex: knee,       // Joint itself
    pointC: ankle       // Bottom of knee
)
```

**Ranges:**
- 80-100°: ✅ **GOOD** (proper squat depth)
- < 80°: ❌ **TOO DEEP** (excessive knee flexion)
- > 100°: ❌ **NOT DEEP ENOUGH** (partial squat)

**Real-World Example:**
- Standing: ~180° (straight leg)
- Quarter squat: ~120-140°
- Parallel squat: ~90-100° ✅
- Deep squat (ATG): ~60-80°

---

### **2. Knee Forward Position**

**Calculation:**
```swift
kneeForward = abs(knee.x - ankle.x)
```

**Interpretation:**
- 0-30px: ✅ **GOOD** (knee tracking properly)
- 31-50px: ⚠️ **WARNING** (getting too forward)
- 50px+: ❌ **BAD** (excessive forward travel)

**Why `abs()`?**
- In side view, we don't know if left or right side
- We just care about distance, not direction

---

### **3. Back Angle (Torso Lean)**

**Calculation:**
```swift
backAngle = angleFromVertical(shoulder, hip)
```

**Using atan2:**
```swift
deltaX = hip.x - shoulder.x
deltaY = hip.y - shoulder.y  // Screen coords
angleRadians = atan2(deltaX, -deltaY)  // Negative Y!
```

**Ranges:**
- 0-30°: ✅ **EXCELLENT** (very upright)
- 30-60°: ✅ **GOOD** (acceptable lean)
- 60-90°: ❌ **BAD** (too much lean)

---

### **4. Squat Depth Detection**

**Calculation:**
```swift
hipDropAmount = hipY - kneeY  // Screen Y increases downward
isInSquat = hipDropAmount > 50 pixels
```

**Why 50 pixels?**
- At 5-7 feet distance with 1280x720 resolution
- 50 pixels ≈ 6-8 inches of real-world depth
- Ensures "breaking parallel" (hips below knees)

**Thresholds:**
```
Hip above knee:   Drop < 10px  → Standing
Hip near knee:    10-50px      → Descending/Ascending  
Hip below knee:   Drop > 50px  → In Squat ✅
```

---

## 🧪 Debugging Output (Now Added)

### **Every Frame Shows:**

```
🔍 State Detection: Hip Y=450, Knee Y=380, Drop=70px, Threshold=50px, InSquat=true
```

### **When in Squat State:**

```
📐 Analyzing form using right side
   Knee Angle: 92.3°
   Knee Angle Good: true (range: 80.0-100.0°)
   Knee Forward: 15px (threshold: 30px), Good: true
   Back Angle: 45.2° from vertical (threshold: 60.0°), Good: true
   Overall Form: ✅ GOOD - None
```

### **When Form is Bad:**

```
📐 Analyzing form using right side
   Knee Angle: 72.5°
   Knee Angle Good: false (range: 80.0-100.0°)
   Knee Forward: 45px (threshold: 30px), Good: false
   Back Angle: 38.1° from vertical (threshold: 60.0°), Good: true
   Overall Form: ❌ BAD - Knees too far forward
```

## ✅ What Was Improved

### **1. Increased Depth Threshold**
- **Before**: 20 pixels (too small)
- **After**: 50 pixels (realistic for side view)
- **Impact**: Now properly detects when user is in squat position

### **2. Side View Support**
- **Before**: Required all 8 joints from both sides
- **After**: Works with one complete side (left OR right)
- **Impact**: Compatible with side profile view

### **3. Comprehensive Debugging**
- **Before**: Silent processing, hard to debug
- **After**: Detailed logs for every calculation
- **Impact**: Can see exactly what's being detected

### **4. Confidence Checking**
- **Before**: Didn't check confidence levels
- **After**: Only uses joints with confidence ≥ 0.5
- **Impact**: More reliable analysis

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Test 1: Verify State Detection**

1. **Build and run** on device
2. **Stand normally** (side view to camera)
3. **Check console:**

```
🔍 State Detection: Hip Y=300, Knee Y=450, Drop=-150px, Threshold=50px, InSquat=false
```
- Drop should be **negative** (hip above knee)
- InSquat should be **false**

4. **Slowly squat down**
5. **Check console:**

```
🔍 State Detection: Hip Y=510, Knee Y=450, Drop=60px, Threshold=50px, InSquat=true
```
- Drop should be **positive 50+** (hip below knee)
- InSquat should be **true** ← This triggers form analysis!

---

### **Test 2: Verify Form Analysis**

**When you reach bottom of squat:**

```
🎯 Form Analysis:
   State: In Squat 🏋️
   Form: ✅ GOOD
   Knee Angle: 92.3°
   Issue: None
   Reps: 0 total
```

**Expected detailed logs:**
```
📐 Analyzing form using right side
   Knee Angle: 92.3°
   Knee Angle Good: true (range: 80.0-100.0°)
   Knee Forward: 12px (threshold: 30px), Good: true
   Back Angle: 42.8° from vertical (threshold: 60.0°), Good: true
   Overall Form: ✅ GOOD - None
```

---

### **Test 3: Verify Bad Form Detection**

**Push knees forward during squat:**

```
📐 Analyzing form using right side
   Knee Angle: 88.5°
   Knee Angle Good: true
   Knee Forward: 45px (threshold: 30px), Good: false ← Detected!
   Back Angle: 38.1° from vertical, Good: true
   Overall Form: ❌ BAD - Knees too far forward
```

**Expected visual:**
- Skeleton turns **RED** immediately

## 🎯 Real-Time Process Flow

### **Frame N (Standing):**
```
1. Detect joints → hipY=300, kneeY=450
2. Check depth → 300-450 = -150 (hip ABOVE knee)
3. State → Standing
4. Form analysis → SKIP (not in squat)
5. Skeleton → Green (default)
```

### **Frame N+15 (Descending):**
```
1. Detect joints → hipY=380, kneeY=450
2. Check depth → 380-450 = -70 (still above)
3. Hip moving down → State: Descending
4. Form analysis → SKIP (not deep enough yet)
5. Skeleton → Green
```

### **Frame N+30 (Bottom - In Squat):**
```
1. Detect joints → hipY=510, kneeY=450
2. Check depth → 510-450 = 60px (hip BELOW knee by 60px)
3. State → InSquat ← TRIGGERS ANALYSIS!
4. Form analysis:
   a. Calculate knee angle → 92°
   b. Check knee forward → 15px
   c. Check back angle → 45°
   d. All pass → isGoodForm = true
5. Skeleton → Green ✅
```

### **Frame N+45 (Bad Form - Knees Forward):**
```
1. Detect joints → hipY=510, kneeY=450, kneeX=240, ankleX=200
2. State → InSquat
3. Form analysis:
   a. Calculate knee angle → 88° ✅
   b. Check knee forward → 40px ❌ (exceeds 30px threshold)
   c. Check back angle → 42° ✅
   d. Knee position fails → isGoodForm = false
4. Skeleton → RED ❌ (immediate visual feedback)
5. Primary issue → "Knees too far forward"
```

---

## 🎨 Visual Feedback Mapping

### **Form Check Results → Skeleton Color:**

```swift
// In didUpdatePoseData
let skeletonColor = formResult.isGoodForm ? .systemGreen : .systemRed
skeletonRenderer?.updateSkeleton(poseData: data, color: skeletonColor)
```

**Colors:**
- ✅ **Green**: All form checks passed
- ❌ **Red**: At least one form check failed

**Latency**: < 100ms (same-frame update)

---

## 🔬 Angle Calculation Math

### **Knee Angle (Hip-Knee-Ankle):**

```swift
// Vectors from knee to hip and knee to ankle
vector1 = hip - knee
vector2 = ankle - knee

// Dot product formula
dotProduct = vector1.x * vector2.x + vector1.y * vector2.y
magnitude1 = sqrt(vector1.x² + vector1.y²)
magnitude2 = sqrt(vector2.x² + vector2.y²)

// Angle in radians
cosAngle = dotProduct / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)
angleRadians = acos(clamp(cosAngle, -1, 1))

// Convert to degrees
angleDegrees = angleRadians * 180 / π
```

**Result**: Angle between 0-180°
- ~180° = Straight leg (standing)
- ~90° = Perfect parallel squat
- ~60° = Very deep squat

---

### **Back Angle from Vertical:**

```swift
// Line from shoulder to hip
deltaX = hip.x - shoulder.x
deltaY = hip.y - shoulder.y

// Angle from vertical using atan2
angleRadians = atan2(deltaX, -deltaY)  // Negative Y for screen coords!
angleDegrees = abs(angleRadians * 180 / π)
```

**Result**: Angle from vertical
- 0° = Perfectly upright
- 30° = Slight forward lean (good for squats)
- 60° = Maximum acceptable lean
- 90° = Completely horizontal (terrible form!)

---

## 🎯 Priority System for Issues

When multiple form problems exist, report in this order:

1. **Priority 1: Knee Angle**
   - Most critical for injury prevention
   - "Knee angle too small (65°)" or "Not deep enough (110°)"

2. **Priority 2: Knee Forward Position**
   - Common error, easy to fix
   - "Knees too far forward"

3. **Priority 3: Back Angle**
   - Important but less immediate
   - "Keep back more upright (72° lean)"

---

## 📝 Debugging Checklist

If form analysis isn't working, check console for:

### **State Detection Debug:**
```
🔍 State Detection: Hip Y=510, Knee Y=450, Drop=60px, Threshold=50px, InSquat=true
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Hip Y and Knee Y values make sense (hip should be > knee when squatting)
- [ ] Drop amount > 50 when in deep squat position
- [ ] InSquat = true when at bottom
- [ ] InSquat = false when standing

### **Form Analysis Debug:**
```
📐 Analyzing form using right side
   Knee Angle: 92.3°
   Knee Angle Good: true (range: 80.0-100.0°)
   ...
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] "Analyzing form" message only appears when in squat
- [ ] Knee angle is calculated (not N/A)
- [ ] Angle value is realistic (60-120° range)
- [ ] Form checks are evaluating correctly

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### **Good Form Squat:**
```
Standing → Descending → In Squat (GREEN, 92° knee angle) → Ascending → Standing
Rep count: +1 good rep
```

### **Bad Form Squat (Knees Forward):**
```
Standing → Descending → In Squat (RED, knees 40px forward) → Ascending → Standing
Rep count: +1 bad rep
Issue: "Knees too far forward"
```
