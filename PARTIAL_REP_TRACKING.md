# Partial Rep Tracking - Complete Movement Acknowledgment

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED - All Squat Attempts Tracked!

The system now tracks and acknowledges ALL squat movements, not just those reaching full depth!

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### **Before (Unresponsive):**
```
User does:
- 3 full depth squats
- 2 shallow attempts (95% down)

System shows:
Total: 3 reps

User thinks:
"I did 5 squats, why only 3 counted?" 😕
"System is broken or not responsive"
```

### **After (Responsive):**
```
User does:
- 3 full depth squats
- 2 shallow attempts

System shows:
Total: 5 attempts | Full: 3 | Partial: 2

User knows:
"I did 5 attempts, 3 reached depth, 2 were shallow" ✅
"System is working and tracking everything!"
```

## 📊 Rep Categories

### **1. Full Reps (Reached Depth)**

**Criteria:**
- Reached `.inSquat` state
- Hip-to-ankle < 150px
- Full squat cycle completed

**Subcategories:**
- **Good Form**: All checks passed during squat
- **Bad Form**: One or more checks failed

**Example:**
```
Standing → Descending → InSquat (depth 140px ✅) → Ascending → Standing

Result: FULL REP (categorized as good or bad based on form)
```

---

### **2. Partial Reps (Didn't Reach Depth)**

**Criteria:**
- Started descending
- Never reached `.inSquat` state
- Hip-to-ankle stayed > 150px
- Returned to standing

**No form assessment** (can't check form without reaching depth)

**Example:**
```
Standing → Descending (lowest: 160px ❌) → Ascending → Standing

Result: PARTIAL REP (acknowledged but not form-graded)
```

---

### **3. Not Counted (No Movement Pattern)**

**Criteria:**
- Random movements
- No clear descent pattern
- Just standing around

**Example:**
```
Standing → Standing → Standing

Result: Not counted (no attempt made)
```

---

## 🎨 Display Format

### **Example Outputs:**

**After 3 Full Good, 2 Full Bad, 1 Partial:**
```
📊 Rep Summary: Total Attempts: 6 | Full: 5 (✅3 good, ❌2 bad) | Partial: 1
```

**After 5 Full (all good), 0 Partial:**
```
📊 Rep Summary: Total Attempts: 5 | Full: 5 (✅5 good, ❌0 bad)
```

**After 0 Full, 3 Partial:**
```
📊 Rep Summary: Total Attempts: 3 | Full: 0 | Partial: 3
```

## 📋 Console Output Examples

### **Full Rep (Good Form):**
```
🔄 Starting new squat attempt

[Squat down...]
Hip-to-Ankle: 300px → 200px → 140px
✨ STATE CONFIRMED: descending → inSquat ✨

📐 Analyzing form
   Knee Angle: 92° ✅
   Knees Forward: 28px ✅
   Back Angle: 45° ✅
   Overall Form: ✅ GOOD

[Stand up...]
✨ STATE CONFIRMED: ascending → standing ✨

✅ FULL REP COUNTED: #1 - GOOD FORM
📊 Rep Summary: Total Attempts: 1 | Full: 1 (✅1 good, ❌0 bad)
```

---

### **Full Rep (Bad Form):**
```
🔄 Starting new squat attempt

[Squat down...]
Hip-to-Ankle: 140px ✅

📐 Analyzing form
   Knee Angle: 65° ❌
   Knees Forward: 72px ❌
   Issues: Going too deep | Knees too far forward
📊 Rep Tracker: Form is BAD - will count as bad rep

[Stand up...]
✨ STATE CONFIRMED: ascending → standing ✨

❌ FULL REP COUNTED: #1 - BAD FORM
📊 Rep Summary: Total Attempts: 1 | Full: 1 (✅0 good, ❌1 bad)
```

---

### **Partial Rep (Didn't Reach Depth):**
```
🔄 Starting new squat attempt

[Squat down but not deep enough...]
Hip-to-Ankle: 300px → 250px → 200px → 165px
📏 Squat Depth: ❌ SHALLOW (> 150px)
Never reached .inSquat state

[Stand back up...]
✨ STATE CONFIRMED: ascending → standing ✨

⚠️  PARTIAL REP COUNTED: #1 (didn't reach full depth)
📊 Rep Summary: Total Attempts: 1 | Full: 0 | Partial: 1
```

---

### **Mixed Workout (Realistic Example):**
```
Attempt 1: Full, Good Form
✅ FULL REP COUNTED: #1 - GOOD FORM
📊 Total Attempts: 1 | Full: 1 (✅1 good, ❌0 bad)

Attempt 2: Partial (tired, didn't go deep)
⚠️  PARTIAL REP COUNTED: #2
📊 Total Attempts: 2 | Full: 1 | Partial: 1

Attempt 3: Full, Bad Form (knees forward)
❌ FULL REP COUNTED: #2 - BAD FORM
📊 Total Attempts: 3 | Full: 2 (✅1 good, ❌1 bad) | Partial: 1

Attempt 4: Partial (fatigued)
⚠️  PARTIAL REP COUNTED: #4
📊 Total Attempts: 4 | Full: 2 | Partial: 2

Attempt 5: Full, Good Form (recovered!)
✅ FULL REP COUNTED: #3 - GOOD FORM
📊 Total Attempts: 5 | Full: 3 (✅2 good, ❌1 bad) | Partial: 2
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### **1. Complete Activity Tracking**
- All movement attempts acknowledged
- Nothing "lost" or ignored
- User sees full workout picture

### **2. Better User Feedback**
- Knows when they didn't go deep enough
- Understands why some don't count as "full"
- Motivated to reach proper depth

### **3. Professional UX**
- Matches fitness tracker behavior
- Acknowledges all effort
- Provides context for performance

### **4. Training Insights**
```
Session Summary:
Total Attempts: 15
Full Reps: 12 (✅10 good, ❌2 bad)
Partial Reps: 3

Insights:
- 80% reached full depth (good!)
- 20% were shallow (fatigue toward end?)
- 83% of full reps had good form (excellent!)
```

## 📱 Integration Points

### **For On-Screen Display:**

```swift
// Simple display
"Reps: \(repData.totalAttempts)"

// Detailed display
"Total: \(repData.totalAttempts) | Full: \(repData.totalReps) | Partial: \(repData.partialReps)"

// With form breakdown
"""
Total Attempts: \(repData.totalAttempts)
Full Reps: \(repData.totalReps)
  - Good Form: \(repData.goodFormReps)
  - Bad Form: \(repData.badFormReps)
Partial Reps: \(repData.partialReps)
"""
```

## 🔬 Detection Logic

### **Movement Pattern Classification:**

**Full Rep:**
```
States: Standing → Descending → InSquat → Ascending → Standing
Depth: Hip-to-ankle < 150px at some point
Count as: Full rep (with form quality)
```

**Partial Rep:**
```
States: Standing → Descending → Ascending → Standing
Depth: Hip-to-ankle stayed > 150px throughout
Count as: Partial rep (no form grade)
```

**Not Counted:**
```
States: Standing → Standing (no descent)
        or Standing → Descending (interrupted, didn't return)
Count as: Nothing (no complete movement)
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Mix of Full and Partial**

**Do this:**
1. Full squat (deep)
2. Partial squat (shallow)
3. Full squat (deep)

**Expected:**
```
Attempt 1: Full rep (good or bad depending on form)
Attempt 2: Partial rep
Attempt 3: Full rep

Console:
Total Attempts: 3 | Full: 2 | Partial: 1
```

---

### **Test 2: Progressive Fatigue**

**Real workout pattern:**
- Reps 1-5: Full depth (strong)
- Reps 6-7: Partial (getting tired)
- Rep 8: Full depth (final push)

**Expected:**
```
Total Attempts: 8 | Full: 6 | Partial: 2
```

---

## 📊 Your Console Results

### **From Your Log:**

**Attempt 1:**
