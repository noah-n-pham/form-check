# Threshold Normalization Summary

## Executive Summary

**Problem Solved:** Form analysis now uses body-proportion-based thresholds instead of fixed pixel values, ensuring consistent and accurate assessment across different user body sizes and camera distances.

**Key Change:** Knee forward threshold changed from **50px** (fixed) ‚Üí **25% of shin length** (normalized)

---

## Before vs After

### BEFORE: Fixed Pixel Thresholds ‚ùå
```swift
// Constants.swift
static let KNEE_FORWARD_THRESHOLD = 50.0  // pixels

// SquatAnalyzer.swift
let kneeForward = abs(knee.x - ankle.x)
let isGood = kneeForward <= 50.0  // pixels
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Tall user (400px shin): 50px = 12.5% of shin ‚Üí too strict
- ‚ùå Short user (200px shin): 50px = 25% of shin ‚Üí lenient
- ‚ùå Far camera (150px shin): 50px = 33% of shin ‚Üí very lenient
- ‚ùå Close camera (300px shin): 50px = 16.7% of shin ‚Üí too strict

**Result:** Inconsistent form assessment based on factors unrelated to actual biomechanics.

### AFTER: Normalized Thresholds ‚úÖ
```swift
// Constants.swift
static let KNEE_FORWARD_THRESHOLD_PERCENT = 25.0  // % of shin

// SquatAnalyzer.swift
let shinLength = abs(ankle.y - knee.y)  // Reference measurement
let kneeForward = abs(knee.x - ankle.x)
let kneeForwardPercent = (kneeForward / shinLength) * 100.0
let isGood = kneeForwardPercent <= 25.0  // % of shin
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Tall user (400px shin): 100px = 25% ‚Üí consistent standard
- ‚úÖ Short user (200px shin): 50px = 25% ‚Üí same standard
- ‚úÖ Far camera (150px shin): 37.5px = 25% ‚Üí same standard
- ‚úÖ Close camera (300px shin): 75px = 25% ‚Üí same standard

**Result:** Biomechanically consistent assessment regardless of body size or camera setup.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `Constants.swift`
```swift
// OLD
static let KNEE_FORWARD_THRESHOLD = 50.0

// NEW
static let KNEE_FORWARD_THRESHOLD_PERCENT = 25.0
```

#### 2. `SquatAnalyzer.swift`
```swift
// Calculate shin length as reference
let shinLength = abs(finalAnkle.y - finalKnee.y)

// Calculate absolute knee forward distance
let kneeForwardAbsolute = abs(finalKnee.x - finalAnkle.x)

// Normalize as percentage
let kneeForwardPercent = shinLength > 0 ? 
    (kneeForwardAbsolute / shinLength) * 100.0 : 0.0

// Compare against normalized threshold
let isGoodKneePosition = kneeForwardPercent <= 
    FormCheckConstants.KNEE_FORWARD_THRESHOLD_PERCENT
```

#### 3. Console Output Enhancement
**Before:**
```
üìç Knee Forward: 60px
   ‚Ü≥ Good: ‚ùå (max: 50px)
```

**After:**
```
üìç Knee Forward: 60px (20.0% of shin)
   ‚Ü≥ Shin length: 300px (knee-to-ankle)
   ‚Ü≥ Good: ‚úÖ (max: 25% of shin)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Tall User (6'2")
```
Setup:
- Shin length in frame: 400px
- Knee forward distance: 95px

OLD (Fixed 50px):
  95px > 50px ‚Üí ‚ùå BAD FORM (FALSE POSITIVE)

NEW (25% of shin):
  95 / 400 = 23.75%
  23.75% < 25% ‚Üí ‚úÖ GOOD FORM (CORRECT)
```

### Example 2: Short User (5'2")
```
Setup:
- Shin length in frame: 200px
- Knee forward distance: 60px

OLD (Fixed 50px):
  60px > 50px ‚Üí ‚ùå BAD (barely, but correct)

NEW (25% of shin):
  60 / 200 = 30%
  30% > 25% ‚Üí ‚ùå BAD (CORRECT, and severity is clear)
```

### Example 3: Same User, Different Distances

**Close to camera (5 feet):**
```
Shin: 350px, Knee forward: 80px

OLD: 80px > 50px ‚Üí ‚ùå BAD
NEW: 80/350 = 22.9% ‚Üí ‚úÖ GOOD (CORRECT)
```

**Far from camera (8 feet):**
```
Shin: 180px, Knee forward: 41px

OLD: 41px < 50px ‚Üí ‚úÖ GOOD
NEW: 41/180 = 22.8% ‚Üí ‚úÖ GOOD (CONSISTENT!)
```

**Result:** Same form quality detected at both distances! ‚úÖ

## Testing Validation

### Unit Test Cases

```swift
// Test 1: Tall user with good form
shinLength = 400px
kneeForward = 90px
expected: 90/400 = 22.5% ‚Üí ‚úÖ PASS (< 25%)

// Test 2: Short user with bad form
shinLength = 200px
kneeForward = 60px
expected: 60/200 = 30% ‚Üí ‚ùå FAIL (> 25%)

// Test 3: At threshold
shinLength = 300px
kneeForward = 75px
expected: 75/300 = 25% ‚Üí ‚úÖ PASS (= 25%)

// Test 4: Just over threshold
shinLength = 300px
kneeForward = 76px
expected: 76/300 = 25.3% ‚Üí ‚ùå FAIL (> 25%)
```

### Real User Testing
Based on console logs analysis:
```
User's shin length: ~140-160px
User's knee forward: 53-66px
Percentage: 37-40% of shin

Result: ‚ùå CORRECTLY FLAGGED as bad form
Reason: Excessive forward knee travel (>25% threshold)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Other Measurements to Normalize

1. **Stance Width** (if we add lateral analysis)
   - Reference: Hip width (shoulder-to-shoulder)
   - Threshold: 100-150% of hip width

2. **Hip Lateral Shift** (balance check)
   - Reference: Torso length (shoulder-to-hip)
   - Threshold: <10% of torso length

3. **Bar Path Deviation** (if tracking barbell)
   - Reference: Total body height
   - Threshold: <5% of body height

### Design Pattern for New Measurements

```swift
// 1. Identify reference segment
let referenceLength = calculateRelevantSegment()

// 2. Measure absolute value
let absoluteMeasurement = calculateMeasurement()

// 3. Normalize to percentage
let percentage = (absoluteMeasurement / referenceLength) * 100.0

// 4. Compare against threshold
let isGood = percentage <= THRESHOLD_PERCENT
```

## Conclusion

**The form analysis system now judges squat quality based on what actually matters: body mechanics.**

By normalizing thresholds to body proportions, we've eliminated arbitrary pixel-based assessments and created a system that:
- Works for all body types
- Works at any camera distance
- Provides biomechanically accurate feedback
- Builds user confidence through consistency

**This is how form checking should be done.** ‚úÖ
