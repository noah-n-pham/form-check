## 🎨 Data Structure

### **FormAnalysisResult (Updated):**

```swift
struct FormAnalysisResult {
    let isGoodForm: Bool
    let primaryIssue: String?       // First/highest priority issue
    let allIssues: [String]          // ALL detected issues ← NEW!
    let kneeAngle: Double?
    let squatState: SquatState
    
    var feedbackMessage: String {   // ← NEW! User-friendly combined message
        if isGoodForm {
            return "Good form! ✓"
        } else {
            return allIssues.joined(separator: " | ")
        }
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Form Check Priority Order

### **Checks Performed (in order):**

1. **Knee Angle** (80-100°)
   - Most critical for safety
   - First check performed
   - First in allIssues array if failing

2. **Knee Position** (< 30px forward)
   - Common error
   - Second check
   - Added to allIssues if failing

3. **Back Angle** (< 60° from vertical)
   - Important but less urgent
   - Third check
   - Added to allIssues if failing

**All failing checks are reported!**

---

## 💡 Benefits

### **1. Complete Information**
Users see ALL problems at once:
- No guessing what else is wrong
- Can address multiple issues simultaneously
- Faster progress to good form

### **2. Actionable Feedback**
Each message is specific and actionable:
- "Going too deep" → Don't squat so low
- "Knees too far forward" → Push hips back
- "Keep back more upright" → Chest up

### **3. Efficient Learning**
```
Traditional (one at a time):
Rep 1: "Going too deep" → Fix depth
Rep 2: "Knees forward" → Fix knees
Rep 3: "Back angle" → Fix back
Rep 4: "Good form!" ← Finally!

New (all at once):
Rep 1: "Going too deep | Knees forward | Back angle" → Fix all
Rep 2: "Good form!" ← Much faster!
```

### **4. Professional UX**
- Clear, comprehensive feedback
- Matches fitness trainer behavior
- Shows system intelligence

## 🧪 Test Cases

### **Test 1: Your Current Form**

Based on your console:
```
Knee angle: 65° → "Going too deep"
Knees forward: 80px → "Knees too far forward"
Back angle: 149° → "Keep back more upright"

Expected feedback:
"Going too deep | Knees too far forward | Keep back more upright"

Console shows:
⚠️  Multiple Issues:
   1. Going too deep
   2. Knees too far forward
   3. Keep back more upright
```

### **Test 2: Fix Depth Only**

```
Knee angle: 90° ✅
Knees forward: 80px ❌
Back angle: 149° ❌

Expected feedback:
"Knees too far forward | Keep back more upright"
```

### **Test 3: Perfect Form**

```
Knee angle: 92° ✅
Knees forward: 25px ✅
Back angle: 45° ✅

Expected feedback:
"Good form! ✓"
```

## 📱 Integration Points

### **For On-Screen Display (Future):**

```swift
// In your feedback text bar view
let feedbackLabel = UILabel()
feedbackLabel.text = formResult.feedbackMessage

// Examples:
// "Good form! ✓"
// "Going too deep"
// "Going too deep | Knees too far forward"
// "Going too deep | Knees too far forward | Keep back more upright"
```

### **For Session Summary:**

```swift
// Count most common issues from all reps
var issueCounts: [String: Int] = [:]

for issue in formResult.allIssues {
    issueCounts[issue, default: 0] += 1
}

// Show top 3 most common issues
// "Most common issues: Knees forward (8 reps), Going too deep (5 reps)"
```
