## 📋 PHASE 2: TODO (Your Team)

### Developer 1: Form Analysis Engine

**Create**: `FormAnalyzer.swift`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Calculate knee angle using hip-knee-ankle positions
- [ ] Check if knees are past ankles (knee.x vs ankle.x)
- [ ] Calculate back angle (shoulder-hip vs vertical)
- [ ] Detect squat depth (hip.y vs knee.y)
- [ ] Implement squat state machine (standing → descending → inSquat → ascending)
- [ ] Count reps (track complete cycles)
- [ ] Track good form vs bad form reps
- [ ] Determine primary form issue
- [ ] Implement FormAnalysisDelegate
- [ ] Debounce audio alerts

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

### Developer 2: Visual Overlays

**Create**:
- `SkeletonOverlayView.swift` - Draw skeleton lines
- `AngleIndicatorView.swift` - Show angle arcs at joints
- `FeedbackOverlayView.swift` - Text feedback bar

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Draw lines connecting joints (shoulder-hip-knee-ankle)
- [ ] Color code skeleton based on form (green/red)
- [ ] Draw angle arcs at knee joints
- [ ] Display angle values in degrees
- [ ] Show feedback text bar at top
- [ ] Update text based on form issues
- [ ] Add keypoint dots (similar to test view)
- [ ] Smooth animations/transitions
- [ ] Integrate with CameraViewController

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

### Developer 3: Integration & Polish

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate FormAnalyzer into CameraViewController
- [ ] Wire up visual overlays
- [ ] Create rep counter display (bottom of screen)
- [ ] Build session summary screen
- [ ] Add audio feedback (system sound ID 1053)
- [ ] Implement UserDefaults for lifetime stats
- [ ] Polish animations and transitions
- [ ] Handle edge cases (person leaves frame)
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Estimated Time**: 5-7 hours

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Testing (Current State)

```bash
# 1. Open Xcode project
open FormCheck.xcodeproj

# 2. Select your iPhone as target device

# 3. Build and Run (Cmd+R)

# 4. Grant camera permission

# 5. Position yourself 5-7 feet away (side view)

# 6. Verify colored dots appear on joints
```

### Switching to Production View

When form analysis and overlays are ready:

```swift
// In HomeViewController.swift, line 89:
let cameraVC = CameraViewController()  // Change from CameraTestViewController
navigationController?.pushViewController(cameraVC, animated: true)
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Current Performance:
- **FPS**: 13-16 (target: 15) ✅
- **Detection Rate**: 6-8 joints consistently ✅
- **Confidence**: 0.6-0.9 average ✅
- **Latency**: ~50ms (detection → overlay) ✅
- **Memory**: Stable, no leaks ✅

### Target Performance for Phase 2:
- **FPS**: Maintain 12+ with overlays
- **Overlay Rendering**: < 16ms per frame
- **Form Analysis**: < 10ms per pose update
- **Session Duration**: 10+ minutes without issues

## 🎓 Key Technical Decisions

### Why Front Camera?
- User positions phone to their side
- Front camera captures side profile
- Optimal for squat form analysis

### Why 15 FPS?
- Balance of responsiveness and performance
- Vision framework can handle this reliably
- Smooth enough for real-time feedback
- Conserves battery and heat

### Why Screen Coordinates?
- Overlays need UIKit coordinates
- Conversion done once in CameraPoseManager
- Teams can use coordinates directly
- No duplicate conversion logic

### Why CAShapeLayer?
- High performance (GPU accelerated)
- Position updates are cheap
- No need to recreate layers
- Smooth 60 FPS rendering

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Workarounds

### Limitations:
1. **Requires physical device** (simulator has no camera)
2. **Works best with good lighting** (poor lighting → low confidence)
3. **Side view required** (facing camera reduces accuracy)
4. **Full body must be visible** (partial occlusion reduces joints detected)

### Workarounds:
1. Always test on device
2. Use bright, even lighting
3. Instruct users to position phone to side
4. Show error if < 6 joints detected for 5+ seconds
