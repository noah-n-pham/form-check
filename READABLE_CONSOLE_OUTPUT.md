# Readable Console Output Guide

## ✅ Console Logging Now Throttled

The console now updates at a **readable pace** instead of 15 times per second!

---

## ⏱️ Logging Frequency

### **Position/Depth Checks:**
- Updates every **0.5 seconds** (instead of every frame)
- Easy to read the values
- Still responsive enough to track movement

### **State Changes:**
- Logged **IMMEDIATELY** when they happen
- Not throttled (critical events)
- Shows with ✨✨✨ markers

### **Summary Logs:**
- Printed on state changes OR every **1 second**
- Shows current state, form, reps

## 📊 What You'll See Now

### **Every 0.5 Seconds (Readable):**

## 🎯 What to Look For

### **Test: Do ONE Slow Squat**

**Step 1: Standing (should see negative drop)**
```
Drop Amount: -150px
Interpretation: Hip is ABOVE ⬆️ knee
Is In Squat Depth: ❌ NO
Current State: standing
```

**Step 2: Squatting down (drop becoming less negative)**
```
Drop Amount: -70px
Interpretation: Hip is ABOVE ⬆️ knee by 70px
Is In Squat Depth: ❌ NO
Hip Movement: 80.0px (↓ DOWN)
⬇️  Descending
✨✨✨ STATE CHANGED: standing → descending ✨✨✨
```

**Step 3: Reaching bottom (drop becomes POSITIVE)**
```
Drop Amount: 25px ← POSITIVE!
Interpretation: Hip is BELOW ⬇️ knee by 25px
Is In Squat Depth (>20px): ✅ YES ← CRITICAL!
✅ SQUAT DEPTH REACHED - State: .inSquat
✨✨✨ STATE CHANGED: descending → inSquat ✨✨✨

📊 IN SQUAT STATE - Running form analysis...

📐 Analyzing form using right side
   Knee Angle: 92.3° ← Should appear!
```

**Step 4: Rising up (drop becomes negative again)**
```
Drop Amount: -70px
Hip Movement: -15.0px (↑ UP)
⬆️  Rising from squat
✨✨✨ STATE CHANGED: inSquat → ascending ✨✨✨
```

**Step 5: Standing (complete cycle)**
```
Drop Amount: -150px
🧍 Back to standing
✨✨✨ STATE CHANGED: ascending → standing ✨✨✨

🎯 Form Analysis:
   Reps: 1 total (✅ 1 good, ❌ 0 bad) ← Rep counted!
```

---

## 🔍 Key Values to Check

### **1. Drop Amount**

**When standing:**
- Should be **NEGATIVE** (e.g., -150px, -200px)
- Means hip is above knee
- Normal standing posture

**When squatting:**
- Should become **POSITIVE** (e.g., +25px, +50px)
- Means hip is below knee
- Indicates squat depth

**Critical threshold:**
- If Drop > **20px** → State changes to `.inSquat`
- This triggers form analysis

---

### **2. Hip Y vs Knee Y**

**Screen coordinates (Y increases downward):**

```
Top of screen Y=0
    ↓
Shoulder Y=200
    ↓
Hip (standing) Y=300 ← Smaller Y
    ↓
Knee Y=450 ← Larger Y
    ↓
Hip (squatting) Y=500 ← Even larger Y
    ↓
Ankle Y=550
```

**When squatting, hip moves DOWN:**
- Hip Y increases (300 → 500)
- Knee Y stays ~same (450)
- Drop becomes positive (500 - 450 = +50)

---

### **3. State Transitions**

**Complete cycle should show:**
```

✨✨✨ STATE CHANGED: descending → inSquat ✨✨✨

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If drop is always negative:**

You're not squatting deep enough OR hip/knee detection is swapped.

**Check:**
- When standing, Hip Y should be < Knee Y (e.g., 300 < 450)
- When squatting, Hip Y should be > Knee Y (e.g., 500 > 450)

**If Hip Y is always > Knee Y even when standing:**
- Coordinates might be swapped or inverted
- Very unlikely since skeleton works

---

### **If drop is positive but < 20px:**

You're squatting but not deep enough.

**Solutions:**
1. Squat deeper (hips below knees)
2. Move closer to camera (makes pixels larger)
3. Temporarily lower threshold to 10px for testing

---

### **If drop is > 20px but state doesn't change:**

**Check console for:**
```
Is In Squat Depth (>20px): ✅ YES
```

If you see this but no state change, there's a logic bug (very unlikely with new code).

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**You'll know it's working when you see:**

1. ✅ Position logs every 0.5 seconds (readable pace)
2. ✅ State changes logged immediately (with ✨✨✨)
3. ✅ "Drop Amount" changes from negative to positive when squatting
4. ✅ "Is In Squat Depth: ✅ YES" appears at bottom
5. ✅ "✨✨✨ STATE CHANGED: ... → inSquat ✨✨✨" appears
6. ✅ "📊 IN SQUAT STATE - Running form analysis..." appears
7. ✅ "Knee Angle: XX.X°" appears (not N/A)
8. ✅ Skeleton turns red/green based on form

---

## 🚀 Test Now!

The console is now **readable**. Do one slow squat and you'll be able to see:
- Hip and knee positions every 0.5 seconds
- Drop amount calculation
- When threshold is met
- State transitions (immediate)
- Form analysis results

**The output will clearly show whether:**
1. Hip is dropping below knee (drop becomes positive)
2. Drop exceeds 20px threshold
3. State changes to `.inSquat`
4. Form analysis runs
5. Knee angle is calculated

**Test it now and you'll see exactly what's happening!** 🔍
